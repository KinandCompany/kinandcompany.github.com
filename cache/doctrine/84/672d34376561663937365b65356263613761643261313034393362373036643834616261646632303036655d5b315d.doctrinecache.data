<p>Kin &amp; Company is a Brooklyn-based studio creating objects and spaces at the intersection of objects, furniture, and architecture. The founders and cousins, Joseph Vidich and Kira de Paola, carry their familial connection through a creative process that is rooted in the core principles of collaboration and curiosity.</p>
<p>The designs of Kin seek to engage and invite their users through the combination of simple, elegant shapes with unexpected details and connections. Special focus is given to moments of transition, be it a plane change, the convergence of two materials, or the moment a piece terminates at the floor.</p>
<p>Our workflow emphasizes an integrated design and fabrication process where the act of making becomes a generative part of the design process. We cultivate in-depth knowledge of materials and the techniques used to shape those materials, attending to the quality and precision of every detail. </p>
<p>Kira has a degree in art and interior design from New York University. Joe completed graduate studies in architecture at Columbia University, where he currently he teaches design and fabrication. </p>
