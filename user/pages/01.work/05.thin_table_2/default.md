## Thin Table 2
The Thin 2 is the embodiment of subtlety with its smooth, bent steel frame and whisper touch to the floor. The hovering shelf adds to the illusion that this piece is in the process of floating to the groundâ€”or about to take off.

Made to order in a variety of sizes, materials, and finishes.
